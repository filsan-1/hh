## 🔒 Security Features

We take your security seriously. This application includes several layers of protection:

**Password Security:**
- Your passwords are encrypted using Argon2, the most secure password hashing algorithm available today
- All passwords are automatically hashed and can never be viewed by anyone, including administrators
- Strong password requirements: minimum 12 characters with complexity rules

**Login Protection:**
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks (5 attempts per 5 minutes)
- Automatic account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Secure session management with automatic timeout after 1 hour of inactivity

**Data Protection:**
- HTTPS/SSL support for encrypted communication
- CSRF protection on all forms to prevent cross-site attacks
- Secure cookie handling with HTTP-only flags
- File upload validation (size and type checking)

**Additional Security:**
- Security headers to prevent clickjacking and XSS attacks
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Environment-based configuration to keep secrets safe

## ⚡ Setup Guidelines

### Option 1: Quick Start with Docker 🐳 (Recommended)

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose:
   - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/filsan-1/hh.git
cd hh
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.docker .env
# Edit .env and set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
./docker-start.sh
# OR manually:
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`

6. Create a superuser:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Docker Commands:**
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f web

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild after changes
docker-compose up -d --build

# Access Django shell
docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

**Quick Start:**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/filsan-1/hh.git
cd hh
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create static files directory:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

6. Create a superuser (admin account):
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

8. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

**Testing Security Features:**

You can verify that password encryption is working properly:
```bash
python manage.py check_password_security
```

This will show you which password hashing algorithm is being used (should be Argon2).


## 🔧 Configuration

For production deployment, create a `.env` file with your settings:
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
```

See `.env.example` for more configuration options.

## Future Prospects:

- Location detection and details of nearby gynecologist.
- Adding a quiz app that will take inputs about periods and give information on what is right and wrong.
